# Project Modular Architecture

## Context

Deciding how to to split the whole in sub-module to enforce the Hexagonal architecture.

## Decision

The root project will be the parent and the aggregator for all the modules.

As of now the project will be split in the application module, which contains the domain, the services and the ports, and one module for every adapter. As for now the adapters expected are the Web Adapter, Persistence Adapter and Rest Adapter.

## Status

Only the application module is actually present.

## Consequences

As the build artifacts are planned at the moment there won't be the possibility to enforce a No mapping strategy for the entities, since the adapters will need to depend on the whole application module.

I expect to further split the application module in the future, possibily to put the ports and/or the domain in different modules once the project is better defined.
