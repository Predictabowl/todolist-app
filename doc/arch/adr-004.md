# Input Validation Responsibility

## Context

Who is responsible for input validation?

The initial approach was to let the DTO object to be self validating entites, but this approach put logic into basic POJO, which is somethign that I don't like.

## Decision

Spring Validation will be used, and input models will simply use the java bean validation annotations included in Spring.

The actual validation will be done by controllers and services.

## Status

Only input model are considered for this type of validation, as of now only one of these objects exists.

## Consequences

With this approach is possible to build entities in a non valid state, while letting them self validate have the advantage to always be sure that an entity is in a valid state.

Another issues that is that is imperative to control that each use case implement a validation of some sort.
