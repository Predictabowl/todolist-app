# Early Mapping Strategy

## Context

Deciding which entities will be visible and usable outside the application layer.

At the moment the application module contains the domain entities, the services and the ports.

## Decision

Since this early in the projec the goal is to lay out the essential services needed, the application module contain all the needed parts to easy try different architecture approaches. For this veru reason there's no mapping present at the moment and the ports use directly the domain entities.

## Status

work in progress.

## Consequences

As the project will be fleshed out the intent is to further split the application-module as needed to enforce architecture boundaries.

This will imply to probably update the ports so they will use dedicated input and output models in such a way that the domain entities won't be needed outside the application layer.
