# Entity IDs format

## Context

How the identifiers of entities shold be modeled?

The identifiers should not be dependant on how the entities are store by the persistance layer.

## Decision

Every entity will be identified by an unique string, there will be no validation on this string, other than not be empty.

The persistance layer should model the id with whatever format is more suitable, but this format should not be necessarily the same as the one passed to the other layers.

If an invalid id is passed to the persistence layer it simply should be treated as an entity not found, and should not generate any error.

## Status

Completed.

## Consequences

The persistence layer will need to validate the passed id before any real call to the database.

The persistence layer can choose to return out a completely different id than the one it uses internally, as long as its unique and can associate it uniquly to a single entry in the database (for example it could generate a slug).
