# Port DTOs refactoring

## Context

Should the input and optput models contains logic?

It makes sense for the inward ports to contain validation logic because their purpose is to assure that data coming from outside is always valid, after that initial barrier the responsibility of keeping data valid shift to the application layer, and this is ensured indirectly with unit tests on the business logic.

In the other hand data that come from outside and data used in the outward ports (drivers) do not need any logic, and this should be somehow enforced.

## Decision

Web DTOs (coming from user input) and outward ports data are converted from normal POJO to Java Record, which makes them implicitly final.

## Status

Completed.

## Consequences

Changing those transfer data as being final, indirectly tells that any data manipulation should be left to the application layer, because it's the only one which have access to both inward and outward ports.
