# The need of Validating valid inputs

## Context

Inward port input models are build to be implicitly valid, as an exception will raise on costruction if the data are not valid.

So why not use directly these input models in the web adapters?

## Decision

The answer is not binary, as in some cases it make sense to use directly the port input models as constrollers input models. The philosophy here is to evaluate each situation and decide if is worth make a new model on a case by case basis.

Generally is preferred to have dedicated input models, found in the "webcommons" package, and indicated with the suffix "WebDto". These models are made to make easier the validation using Spring mechanisms, and they will be later mapped in input port own self-validating DTOs.

## Status

Completed.

## Consequences

The reason of this choice is because the validation required by the application layer is not necessarily the same required by, for example, a web interface. Is also worth pointing out that if data is not valid, normally we don't want to throw an exception, but instead we want to deal with the situation accordingly.

This means that the inward port validation will fail only when the outside validation fails, this is an error but the web adapter, an occasion that should not happen normally, and thus that will be the right moment for the port layer to throw out an exception.
