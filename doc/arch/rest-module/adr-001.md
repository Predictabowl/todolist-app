# Which Input model to be used

## Context

Rest controllers problably would need their own input models to be then mapped in inward port input models.

The inward port DTOs are implemented to be selfvalidating and to throw a ContraintViolationException when not valid.

SpringBoot automaticcaly respond with a Bad Request when the input model is not valid.

## Decision

Rest controlled will directly use the port input models instead of their own.

As is stand right now a new batch of input models would be almost identical to the one already present in the in-port module, with the only difference that they wouldn't be self validating. 

Considering the default behaviour of Spring Boot the result would be exactly the same and so this decision was made to save time and avoid to implements mappers.

## Status

Completed.

## Consequences

With this decision the single reposibility principle is broken, this means that changes to inward port DTOs will propagate in the rest module, probably breaking the functionality and requiring to test the whole module.

It's over reliant on Spring Boot automatic exception handling, this can make difficult to understand how it works on a first glance.

In case of future extensive changes to the port's DTOs it could be a good idea to change the rest module first and introduce its own DTOs with mappers, this way the sole point of failure would be the mapper itself, and so easy to locate and correct.
